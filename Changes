Added OpenEx()

The path passed to Open(), OpenEx(), Create() and CreateEx() may be either relative
to the key or absolute. All methods may even be caled as normal functions.

All methods that return some value(s) may now be used either as both
	$obj->Foo($params, $result)
and
	$result = $obj->Foo($params)

Added SetValues() method that allows you to set several values in a key in one call.

Added QueryType()

$HKCR->Connect($computername, $rHKCR) now opens the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes on that computer (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
cannot be connected directly. At least it could not under WinNT.)

Added GetValue() (gives you the specified value in the current key. Compare
with QueryValue() that gives you the default value of the specified SUBKEY.)

Added QueryInfoKey() which gives you more data than QueryKey()

Added ForKeys() - calls your handler for all subkeys of the current key.

Added GetOnlyValues() - similar to GetValues(), creates hash that contains just
	name => value
GetValues() creates a hash with
	name => [name, type, value]

DeleteKey() is able to delete the keys recursively (even if the OS itself is not)

Added MoveKey(), CopyKey() and FlushKey().

Added FindKey(), FindKeyDepth(), FindValue(), FindValueDepth()
- designed after File::Find, traverse through a tree of keys in the registry
and calls a handler for each key/value found.

Hives may be loaded either persistently or temporarily.
In the second case they are automaticaly unloaded when the script exits.

Added Import(), ImportStr() and Export() - export and import in the REGEDIT4 format
(the plaintext format used by regedit.exe in Win9x/NT)

Completely rewriten the docs (and the whole Perl part of the module).
